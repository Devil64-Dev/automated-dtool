# Automated Download Tool

**!! Project status**

I am writing a new version of this program, which will solve several errors.
The new version only supports GNU/Linux (ArchLinux, Ubuntu, Debian and derivates).

Windows support needs more time to be tested. (you can test it on WSL and send reports to me)

MacOS (it not will be tested)

The program can run on VirtualBox, or LiveUSB (the second is best).

I can write a guide to use the program in a Live System (Live USB), please open a issue if
you need it.
